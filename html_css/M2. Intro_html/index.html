            <p>The field of user experience has a wide range of research methods available, ranging from tried-and-true methods such as lab-based usability testing to those that have been more recently developed, such as unmoderated UX assessments.</p>

            <h2>The Attitudinal vs. Behavioral Dimension</h2>
            <p>This distinction can be summed up by contrasting "what people say" versus "what people do" (very often the two are quite different). The purpose of attitudinal research is usually to understand or measure people's stated beliefs, but it is limited by what people are aware of and willing to report.</p>
